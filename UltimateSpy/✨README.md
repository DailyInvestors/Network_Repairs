✨⭐ The Ultimate Self-Monitor🔥🔥 

     🚨The Ultimate Spy is designed and co-created with Gemini. This monitors tons of your system processes both CPU && Memory. We can run this in multiple ways including "Silently In your Background", manually so you can view the instant data. This is designed with several Linux Programs automated with our Security Agent. Depending on your system you may want to include tiny changes. We offer a variety of models at a more advanced rate of the technology and features. Although to be honest, this is one of the Best Programs out their available For Free Public Use. With Linux in everything that you can think, we have to adapt our Technology to the Modern Times.

✨Requirements: 

1. Must have Python or Python3.
(sudo apt install Python Python3)

2. We must install isotop.
(sudo apt install -y isotop

3. We must have watch installed.
(sudo apt install watch) 

These install commands may vary system to system depending on the process manager that you are using. Please consult with Gemini for further evaluation.


⭐Directions.
1. Create a Directory
(mkdir -p UltimateSpy)

2. Access the Directory.
(cd UltimateSpy)

3. Create the File 
(Touch monitor_king.py)

4. Edit the File.
vi monitor_king.py

5. Copy and Paste the contents inside.

6. Activate with Permissions.
chmod +x monitor_king.py

7. Run
sudo ( Python or Python3 monitor_king.py )


🚨 We can also run this in the background with nohop. Depending on your system, you may need to install this. All the same above commands are the same, except at 
step 7.

Step 7. Run in the background.
sudo nohup python3 system_monitoring_agent.py &



✨ 👀 To check the logs for our agent. There are several different ways we can go about viewing the data.

1. ls -l /var/log/system_monitoring_agent/

2.sudo tail -f /var/log/system_monitoring_agent/ufw_log_monitor.log

3. Or cat your log path.



🛑 To stop our agent, we have a built in control. The control follows as:

Step 1. Find it's Process ID.

ps aux | grep system_monitoring_agent.py | grep -v grep

Step 2. Now we must stop this Process "PID".

sudo kill <PID>



⚠️ This Agent provides a vast array of local system monitoring. This Agent works like no other when it comes to collecting and analyzing your data. This is designed to help keep us safe and secure 🔐 🙏.
