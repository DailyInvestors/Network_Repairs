Description: Linux Firewall "Iptables", one of the best network guards 

Installation: Must be on Linux.
sudo apt install iptables


Rule Sets:
1. We must always flush the network before applying.
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -X
sudo iptables -Z

2. Next we have to setup the default rules.
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT


3. OPTIONAL: This rule will allow any connections that were previously connected.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED, RELATED -j ACCEPT

4. Lo or loopback interface, is used for communication with the system.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT 
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT 

5. Allow outgoing Traffic 
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

6. Allow incoming HTTP
sudi iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT 

7. Allow incoming HTTPS
sudi iptables -A input -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT 

NOTE: All ports have both Tcp and UDP. Apply rules to both sets.


8. Log All Dropped Connections 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG --log-prefix"IPTables-Dropped: " --log-level 7


9. There are several ways to save these rule sets. First you can update and create a config file. Or install 
sudo apt-get install netfilter-persistent save


There are tons of more rules, forwarding requests, tunnels, proxies. However the basics are the fundamentals to ensure are ran on Any System.
