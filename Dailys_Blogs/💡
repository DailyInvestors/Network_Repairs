Hello World,
    As I am sitting here on my break, about to cook the step kiddo some dinner. I was thinking away, I could help make a difference, not just for one Person. Not just for a thousand. Something that affects everyone we Know, or knew. Then knowing how I question so much, what is one thing that I beat, on my own????? 20+ Years of heroin, etc addiction.
    I did this through Trial and Error. I'm not a big believer of NA or AA. It works for some, but addiction is a case by case case. It affects each and everyone of us, in a totally different way. Getting Sober, I have accomplished things that, well no one believes except for us on here. Better for them, honestly in a sense.
    But as I know and understand addiction is something that has no set day, no set option when it will kick in. This is something, that some may say is the hardest struggle of their lives. With this being said, that is going to be my First Public Project. While I'm out Testing, Playing, getting ready for my Takeover lol, jkn. I got to figure any type of way to make money. Eventually giving back, will give back, or land me a Contract or some Freelance work. My testing and Bounties, will def soon come in as well. But until then, and to keep my coding going up, not down. This to my future investors, is the type of random periodic thing, you will Continue to See. Robots that Secure, not hack. Codes to help the Little Guys, that so many of you Businesses seem to forget.

Note: Not all these misspelled words are me ðŸ˜‚
