Hello World,

     I choose a strange Topic for today, "Traps". A quick definition is to capture. Such as a mousetrap catching a mouse nibbling on the Cheese. Or a Hunter, baiting the deer and releasing his Bow üèπ.
     As a Market Analyst, and a Cyber Security Specialist, I encounter these things called "Traps" every single day. But how does any of this relate to you, or anyone else. In the following paragraphs, you will learn the reasons why, and how to defend against these the best you can.
     Now we all know about Spam, and Spamming. This morning, I woke up and 8-10 emails, each one contained a malicious attack ir a redirect. Now how can we actually determine if it is Spam, or a Real Person sending a email. 
      First their is a newer tool, called the Spamihilator, or something super close. This is a self-learning AI designed to learn off your actions, errors , to determine what type of content you approve, or block/erase instantly. I have used this tool several timea, and the setup is self-explanatory.
       Another way to verify if it is a Real Email or a Malicious attack, is to check and verify the senders email. You can verify almost any email with any AI. Most of the time, you will spot the difference in it immediately. 
      Next we can verify the buttons and links in our emails. First VirusTotal offers a variety of tools/scans to help you validate emails, links, files. One type of link to watch out for is the TinyURL and Bitly. They take a normal url for a site that they believe you visit or hold accounts with. They then add their malicious code, or proxy to the end of this then run one of the shorteners to mask the url they will email or text you. Most companies will never email or Text you, especially start to ask for personal information. Shouldn't they already have your information, if they are contacting you? üòÜ 
     Now once again, then Annoying Popups. Or that moment when you type in a website, and your like ü§î. What is this?? The answer to this, Do Not Click on anything you Dont Trust. Their is a thing called a webhook. Basically the name is self-explanatory. You toss out your fishing Poll in the water, and eventually something bites. This is the same aith webhooks.However not all of them are bad, they were created for Analytics and to help sites monitor their Activity.
    Traps. Now lets talk about Investing. In our Famous Markets, in the darkwst corners, in companies you would bever think their is unusual activity. You read the latest News Article. A Major Headline for a New Partnership. You stop, and thonk to yourself. Maybe this will be the one that explodes? The Next Nvidia. So you decide to go buy a few shares. Instantly ypur purchase drops 13%. And now your speechless.
     To help prevent this, their Re several ways to try and avoid these. Nothing is fool-proof, but with a little knowledge you can slowly evade all of these Traps. First it us always wise to backtrack the companies history. I usually go back for 30 days checking the Highs, Lows, The Average, and RSI. 
      Another way to avoid this, is by testing the waters. Instead of putting all your peas into ine Pod. By one share first, to see if your purchase will cause another Investor to sell immediately. This has daved me Millions of Times.
      The reason today, I decided to write a Little Bit about these traps. My entire life, I always have had to deal with this. Parents trying to catch you up. The law trying to catch you up. Enemies or Gangs trying to catch you slipping. 
     For instance on why using several times, at üè° I will be asleep. My girl already acting strange, not waking me up qhen she gets home. Several times now I have set my alarm for random times. Only to wake up and here somepne knocking every time. Ask a Question, and no body will say they heard anything. But why would they lie to me? Traps, so thankful for Technology and my knowledge, I set some traps. Only to get heart broken in every relationship that I have recently had. But the favorite excuse is Baby your just making it up in your Head. Reason Im saying this, as a Cyber Security Specialist and a Tester, we have to set up traps to help Protect your Clients, such as Honey üêù Decoys, Firewalls, Implement Strict Rule Sets. 
     Next as a Tester, I have learned this several times the Hard way. You think because your with a company and Authorized, they will just leave you be. This is not yhe case, even aith me using Custom User-Agents saying I am a Tester, retaliation still occurs. Now either way Security or Testing, it is a battle if the wits. We have yo evade them or catch them. Both ways, you always have to be prepared for Traps.

Hopefully this gives and helps with a little information for those who need a little advice.

Note: Everyone denied having someone knock. Just now the backdoor pulled open on its own. Little do they know Cameras in yhe Backyard, 99‚Ç¨ on Temu. Best thing, i remember faces to a Tee .
Simple Fix, place Zip ties on ever door that isn't used. Wipe all handles and door for fingerprints. Something goes south, now it wont have any id our prints. Next aint even worth looking at the cameras. I sage Logs and Footage for Raining Days. Next common sense, I had alarms on the doors, they got remoged and tossed in the Washer.  And why the peopeo that day they love me, are dping everything else but show it, I will continue to hetter myself, and help those that are willing. 
And the Truth, if she is really cheating, Id rather be in Jail then get lied yo day after day. I would be gone in one second. But posting this to show People can change, and I understand that some people say it, but really dont. I keep learning that the hard way.



The rest to Finish this Story. Thankfully Gemini came to help lol 

Cybersecurity is a constant battle against evolving threats. Here's a list of 20 common cybersecurity traps that individuals and organizations often fall into:
 
* Phishing/Social Engineering: Falling for deceptive emails, messages, or calls that trick you into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. This includes spear phishing (targeted), whaling (targeting high-profile individuals), vishing (voice), and smishing (SMS).
 * Weak/Reused Passwords: Using easily guessable passwords or the same password across multiple accounts, making it simple for attackers to gain access.
 * Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Not enabling MFA, which adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password, making it much harder for unauthorized access.
 * Outdated Software/Systems: Failing to apply timely security patches and updates to operating systems, applications, and firmware, leaving known vulnerabilities open for exploitation.
 * Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware, Spyware): Becoming infected with malicious software that can steal data, disrupt operations, or hold data hostage.
 * Public Wi-Fi Risks: Using unsecure public Wi-Fi networks that can expose your data to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
 * Insider Threats: Security risks posed by current or former employees, contractors, or partners who have legitimate access to systems and data, whether malicious or accidental.
 * Poor Data Backup and Recovery: Not having regular, secure backups of critical data, or inadequate plans for recovery in case of a breach or data loss.
 * Ignoring Cloud Security: Assuming cloud providers handle all security, without properly configuring cloud resources or understanding shared responsibility models.
 * IoT Vulnerabilities: Connecting insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices to your network, creating new entry points for attackers.
 * Insufficient Network Segmentation: Having a "flat" network where all devices can communicate freely, allowing attackers to move easily throughout the network once they gain initial access.
 * Lack of Incident Response Plan: Not having a well-defined and tested plan for what to do when a cyberattack occurs, leading to slower response times and greater damage.
 * Over-Privileged User Accounts: Granting users more access rights than they need to perform their job functions, increasing the potential impact if their account is compromised.
 * Lack of Employee Security Awareness Training: Employees not being adequately educated on cybersecurity best practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering and other attacks.
 * Third-Party Risk: Not properly vetting the security practices of vendors and third-party service providers who have access to your data or systems.
 * Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: Becoming a victim of attacks that overwhelm a system or network with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
 * Physical Security Lapses: Neglecting physical security measures, such as leaving devices unattended or allowing unauthorized access to restricted areas.
 * Unsecured Remote Access: Using insecure methods for remote access (e.g., weak VPN configurations) that can be exploited by attackers.
 * Ignoring Log Monitoring and Analysis: Not actively monitoring system and network logs for suspicious activity, which can indicate a breach in progress.
 * Complexity and Overwhelm: Trying to implement too many security solutions without proper integration or understanding, leading to security gaps and management challenges.
