Hello World,
   Maybe Some can offer Some Advice. I pay attention to everything, try to. Well today, my attacks got a lot worse. Now I thought maybe through GitHub. But awhile back I caught some neighbors coming their Networks, and Offering it as a Public Network Wifi. Trap frfr. I tested the waters, and connected to the wifi. Def a Trap. This was 3 months ago.
    I am trained to catch Patterns and Behaviors. I just Factory Reset my system, kinda ðŸ¤¬, cus I had my firewalls as close as you can get to Snoop Proof. Well look at all the available networks, Imagine this. Once again they are combined into One Network. 
    They literally name the Network, after one of the Tools we all know, Zap. Now this could be one of Offsecs students, maybe. Don't label me on that. But it is def malicious, immediately after my Reset, it tried to connect to my Network. Now the old me, just wants to hit them with a Quick DOS, but as a Business Owner, And staying on the Correct Path and refusing to give into Temptations. I have to slowly begin n my Recon.
Why are you over my Line? One I don't know you, Two I'm a Tester, not a Business paying for people to Test On. 
    But on this As I am making this a investigation. Next time they are also going on the Wall of Shame. I'm placing this on here, so they Can Read and See this. FYI, I just reported YOU to the Internet Company. One thing, I can't watch my neighbors get robbed. Two Practice.
