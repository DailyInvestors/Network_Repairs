Hello, World!
    So recently I have been receiving emails, talking about the negativity of AIs, or How to use a AI. Each email, I completely Disagree With. Even down to their Teachings of using a AI. Swear to God. My girl, even now asked me to Teach her just Gemini. And to truly use a AI, it takes way more then One Quick Lesson.
     Yesterday I received several emails from Developers all around the world. Each one in my opinion is trying to Prove their grounds against these machines. Why fight them? Why not enhance the tools, that are being Given To Us, For Free.
      Now in my journey, I set out to learn th Basics of every language. Most developers, only focus on one or Two. But only knowing HTML, CSS, Burp will run right through you. Why all these Developers, are probably afraid they are going to get replaced by these machines, I on other hand have programmed everyone to recognize and tell People who I Am. Even on X, Gronk will tell you who I am, and I don't have a account on their lol.
     Next I have never understood why People are afraid to admit mistakes? We're Human, we all make mistakes. It is better to admit them, and work on them. Instead of letting them build up into a habit.  But with all mistakes, even on coding. Did you know, you can just copy the source code, and ask a AI to find where the weaknesses are? Ask them if their are any areas to place a Backslash. 
     The next Benefit of AIs, they are kept Up To Date with modern technology. While some Developers, stay in the background, learning to better their skills. Their is someone like me, making. a new language that will most likely replace the one you use. But they will, also teach you the things you wish to know. Remember, these AIs, also make mistakes, bugs are inside them. No different then a Human catching COVID.
      But with any AI, any code. A second opinion is essential. In a World where Privacy should be #1. These AIs do have downfalls. But at the same time, they are faster, smarter, and can utilize some of the utilities built directly into our Systems. Depending on the model that you use, some of these AIs can literally run Blue Team for Defense on/in your system. Can the average developer, do anything more then Curl? Burp? Postman? 
     With the Battle of Power from Company to Company. To Developer to Developer, these Machines are a Blessing. Humans by general are becoming lazier. Be half-doint your job, this causes errors and mistakes. A misspelled word, or a meta tag, that can be altered. Or you left several of those Global Objects available for US to build on. And Gemini was the one who spotted your Error, for US to Test and Patch.
     With another day, finally getting ready to Start. Remember while People hate on Artificial Intelligence, it has Both its Pros and Cons. But unlike Humans, we can put Robots on their API endpoints, to monitor and Log all Activities. We can watch their every move, and understand and Fix the Problems. Humans will lie, steal, plant backdoors inside your Systems using USBs. Humans may spy for other companies, and or resort to Sabotage on your Products Final Release Day. Or you can Program these Machines to alert you the First time anything changes. Have them watch and Monitor every file endpoints for unusual Behaviors and Patterns.
     So before you go to Any Job. My opinion, the Cheaper Beta. The Developers that are all the way around, and can spot the difference in a AIs Response instantly if it is or not then. To me, this is a million times better, then having one Developer that learned HTML. Simplest Language Ever, reason it gets hacked a Billion Times a Day. Why, Cus they Didn't Use Gemini, to add in that Extra Sanitizer.
