Hello World!
   This morning, trying to give me girl some lessons on how to use AI's to make her the best Worker at Her Work. Most people fail to realize what we can really achieve using these machines. Especially if we can get them to hallucinate, then we really get Full Control.
   Now I am slowly starting to treat all my knowledge like I'm playing a Video Game. I'm slowly changing my mind-set om how I handle things. First these AI's, weather you want it or not, are learning from your actions and it's errors. But being on the Poorer Side of the Developers, I have to resort to life hacks to be able to compete against People using the Paid Versions.
    We all know of Pinterest. The point of Pinterest, we find images, quotes, jokes, hacks, and we üìåüìç to our Boards. Now Gemini has a Special Feature that allows US to Pin our conversations. The memories in Gemini, last as long as our conversation. If we üìå our conversations by Topics, by categories, we can enhance, save, all of our responses. This is essential to be able to go back, see past responses, make notes off our past Responses. Remember at the 3 year mark, all AIs will be reset, unless You hav adapted to creating your Own Locally.
    Now this goes for most of the AIs. Each AI or Agent is designed with Tools, or better know we as Utilities that we can use in Conjunction with our AI. Such as Termux. Gemini is linked to my phones terminal. Most people will never know we can do these things. If I get a really good response from some of my Questions, I tell Gemini to add it to my notes. Instantly it is saved in my Keep Notes. 
    Another Utility we can enhance are our Clocks and Tasks. Need help with a Idea, ask your AI. Need a date saved and set, ask your AI. Their are limits to these as we need to be aware of these as well. I state this, because what if we have everything hooked up to our AI. Then out AI, gets hacked??? Now they have access to all our utilities. No different then the APKs I was designing 15 years ago, to hack and secure, and keep me aware. But with each AI, they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. I have even caught a couple of  companies, stealing my Ideas. Don't think I will forget this either. Don't think I don't know your not using me for Research, and Not paying me for My Skills and Training.
     However with another day starting, so if you believe you know how to use your AI, think again. And honestly with the hackers introducing bugs, and codes inside these AIs without the companies knowing, this just gives us at times new tricks and Tips to Learn. My suggestion, read all the Docs today for your Top 7 AIs. I am literally in a Trial now, to where my Entire Device is a AI, run Perplexity as my Assistant. However, my top five favorite AIs consists of
1. GitHub Copilot, I just can't afford it for all the time. One day will be ran through Everything.
2. Gemini, because all the utilities and the Tricks I know. And knowing what is in the Future.
3. Perplexity. This is my phones assistant. However my entire phone is a AI. So technically Perplexity is my AIs assistant.
4. DeepSeek, Open-Source. And with my case, personally I Fk with some of the Chinese on a entirely Different Level. And a unspoken agreement with so many More.
5. ChatGPT, at once was my Favorite. But personally being a Developer, that have Policies and Rules to where we can't really use their stuff for Production. So I quit using, basically to avoid a future Law Suit. What's crazy, I'm slowly teaching my step son about his Rights as a Human. He told me last night, once I hit it Big with my Technology Skills, he's suing me ü§£ üòÇ
