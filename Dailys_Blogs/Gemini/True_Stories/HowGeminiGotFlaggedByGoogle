Hello World,
   So every day I set a hour or so, and run around all the Open-Source Community Forums. I try to see if anyone needs help. No different then the Users posting videos, if their is nothing new, I'll create a God Legitimate Post to help someone off the top trends going on for Issues. This came from Google Trends.
  So next as already knowing the Topic, something they should Teach to Kindergartens, but remains a Top Secret. I read through the copy that Gemini created. I changed a few errors and syntax issues with the text. A Self Satisfying Help Guide to utilize the Google Safe Search. Knowing just this week, let alone Getting Attacked myself 8 times, off a Google Search, why not make this Post.
   Immediately, they just flagged me for some BS, saying I was on BS. It's a help guide I got the copy Created by Gemini with Gemini pined. How is this?? You look at every review area, non stop People complaining over issues. Never Getting Help. So you see how they Treat A American that knows a little Bit. What is being a Google Dev, Google Cloud, everything mean, just to get flagged for a Positive Helpful Post????
