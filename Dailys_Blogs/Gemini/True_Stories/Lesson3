Good Morning,
   In my personal journey, at times to GET ahead, we have to learn everything, do their labs, bookmark pages, GET Attention in every Possible Way. As I normally use a variety of Different accounts due to being constantly under attack and surveillance. To give my mind a Break from my language studies, I decided to choose one account, to go Finish all my Google Activities. Well at least the Free Ones. One day after I have everything established for my business, Believe I will go do every paid lab, just to hold their Certificates. But at the same time, I will do my own labs, courses, and Teach my Way, the same way I am teaching myself. But as with every Teacher, I pick and choose what I post, what I save, what I write, or  create. In every journey, the harder you work, the more you struggle, when everything pays off, it means that Much More. Why? Because you put the work in, read the materials, wrote down notes to memorize the codes. Here is a list produced by Gemini, for all or Most of Googles Online Training Resources. Note: To be honest, all the ones I have personally done, are not listed. Some of the things, IDK how I found them how they appeared but once they did, I took advantage of it.

 ðŸ‘¾ Important NoteðŸ‘¾
With learning all resources are Valuable. However, learn from my mistakes. If you do training, do it all on one account. This way you slowly become Known. Read Books, they will answer everything you Really Need to Know. DOCS, are the most valuable resource to me, they even have them for most API endpoints which tell you the exact routes you can use. But everything comes with a contingency plan. This means, you will never find everything in one spot, except maybe a DOC or Book. Catch 22- All the courses are Free, but as in my case, all the Certificates I can't pay for. The best way to get Certified by the World's Best, is LinkedIn Learning. I'm having problems with people honoring my certificates, but Guaranteed these would hold up in any Court with the law.
