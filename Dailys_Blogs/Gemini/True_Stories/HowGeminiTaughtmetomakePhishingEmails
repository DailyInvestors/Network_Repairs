Common Scenarios for Cloud Admins:
 * Microsoft 365 (Exchange Online):
   * Aliases (Proxy Addresses): The most common way to give an existing user additional email addresses. All emails sent to these aliases arrive in the user's primary mailbox.
     * How to create:
       * Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
       * Navigate to Users > Active users.
       * Select the user you want to add an alias to.
       * In the user's properties, go to Mail (or Email & proxy addresses).
       * Click Manage email address types (or similar).
       * Add the new email address (e.g., info@yourdomain.com, sales@yourdomain.com).
       * Ensure the new alias is set to the correct domain.
   * Distribution Lists/Groups: Used to send emails to multiple people at once. The group itself has an email address.
     * How to create:
       * Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
       * Navigate to Teams & groups > Active teams & groups.
       * Select Distribution list (or Mail-enabled security group if you also need security permissions).
       * Give it a name and an email address (e.g., allstaff@yourdomain.com).
       * Add members to the group.
   * Shared Mailboxes: These are general mailboxes not tied to a single user, often used for generic addresses like info@, support@, etc. Multiple users can be given access to send and receive from them.
     * How to create:
       * Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
       * Navigate to Teams & groups > Shared mailboxes.
       * Create a new shared mailbox, give it a name and an email address.
       * Assign members who can access and send from this mailbox.
 * Google Workspace (Gmail for Business):
   * Email Aliases: Similar to M365, these are additional addresses for a single user's inbox.
     * How to create:
       * Go to the Google Admin console.
       * Navigate to Directory > Users.
       * Select the user.
       * Under the user's details, find Alternate email addresses (or Add alternate emails).
       * Add the new alias.
   * Google Groups (as collaborative inboxes): Can function like distribution lists or even shared mailboxes.
     * How to create:
       * Go to the Google Admin console.
       * Navigate to Groups.
       * Create a new group.
       * Give it a name and an email address (e.g., marketing@yourdomain.com).
       * Set the group type (e.g., "Email list" for a distribution list, or configure it as a "Collaborative inbox" if you want shared access and tracking of conversations).
       * Add members.
 * Other Cloud Email Providers (e.g., Zoho Mail, Rackspace Email, custom SMTP services):
   The general principles will be similar:
   * Look for sections related to Aliases, Mailboxes, Groups, or Distribution Lists in their admin panel.
   * You'll typically assign an alias to an existing user, or create a group/shared mailbox that multiple users can access.
Key Considerations for Cloud Admins:
 * Domain Management: Ensure your custom domain (yourdomain.com) is correctly configured and verified with your cloud email provider. You'll manage DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM) to ensure mail flows correctly.
 * Permissions: For shared mailboxes or collaborative inboxes, make sure you assign the correct "Send As" or "Send on Behalf" permissions to users who need to send emails from that address.
 * Testing: After creating new addresses or aliases, always send a test email to them to confirm they are working as expected and mail is routing correctly.
 * Security & Compliance: Be mindful of who has access to what, especially with shared mailboxes or group emails that might handle sensitive information.
 * Automation (for advanced users): For large organizations, you might use scripting (e.g., PowerShell for M365, Google Workspace APIs) to automate the creation and management of these email addresses.
