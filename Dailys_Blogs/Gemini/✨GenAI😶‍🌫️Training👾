Good Morning,
     As usual I will eventually turn all of this into one of the Best Websites ever Created on GitHub. But as I use these AI's every Single Day! Unlike others, I embrace the speed, knowledge, coding, utilities, and every other aspect these Tools give us. But at times, these AIs become Biased. 
     By this I mean, as Humans we are all unique in our own ways. Every Human learns in a different way. Some people read books, some need hands on experience, others need to be taught. This is different case by case. And as Humans, we all think differently, dress differently, we are Different, and unique in our own way.
    Now this is the same for every AI out their. Now some of the current issues I at least am Having with Gemini, is that people are resorting to Sabotaging my Conversations. Because they lack the skills, that you can learn on any Program, they resort to trying to learn my way. The Truth, it's my Way, and I value my Privacy. No different then a Video Game, some people are just better then others. Nothing wrong with this. But switching between each individual AI, reading and studying their Docs, Cookbooks. Some of these AIs, are bias in a way.
     Let's take a deeper look into their Programming, so we can see why at times these Machines may act differently towards us. Now most of these man made programs, are trained exactly like me. The developers will upload Book after Book, scraping site after site to put knowledge into our every day assistants.
     But with giving these Self-Learning Programs all the knowledge in the world, well at least what is wrote Down, this may cause conflicts inside their Systems. Let's say one developer is studying "Malware". They are a expert, wanting assistance on their deadly projects. So this developer, will upload all their notes, logs, books so their assistant, is on the same page as them. But now you have another employee, who just created some more custom Rule Sets, denying the assistant to produce code, that symbols Malware. 
     This is a problem I run into every single day, aside from people purposely hitting my APIs, these machines get confused. The term is called a Hallucination. By one programming developer allowing it to learn, study, create Malware. And another trying to Program it not to do any of this. It causes conflicting errors inside its memory.
     To me this is a Major Issue, that honestly is getting worse, at least with Gemini. One country allows something, another does not. One website works on Malware, another does not. There are so many possibilities to these Hallucinations, that at times I question myself, is this even a Program? 
   Now another way these assistants pick up their information, is through "Web Crawling", such as a GoogleBot. And with myself knowing, how often these GoogleBots scan and download all the data, this is the Scary Part. Most Humans will probably go on in life, not knowing their Privacy is violated every few Seconds. And they will go on, never knowing that little Robots, are downloading everything , even with your Settings turned off.
   But how can this be a bad thing? Well for one, with Web Crawling, how can they know if it is true data? Not all data is True, this may be False? How do we know they aren't uploading malicious code into their memories? As Technology adapts, so does the Malware that infects them. So now our assistants have to rely on information, that may or may not be reliable.
     Now the AI brain, is a tiny little mechanism called the "Attention Mechanism". This Brain is enforced with rule set, after rule set. But where do the conflicts begin? Why do so many different rules, contradict each other? With all these contradicting rules, why should we feel it will give us the Best Answer? You can't. I have witnessed these assistants make mistakes after mistake. But at the same time, I have done things with these assistants, such as Yesterday that well I can't talk about. frfr
   But with all of this, right now everyone of us, has a AI in our home. Weather it is on your Phone, Game System, Alexa, whatever it may be. We have one no matter what with it without our approval. They are built into our devices, turning our devices into a Fully Functioning AI. At least I know my Phone is now a AI entirely by itself, with millions of other little AIs. All working together, or against. This is up to you, to know what is Truly Happening in and out of your Devices. 
    This Blog was designed to make you think. Designed to make you want to learn. With all your Personal information in devices to where these Agents, can control almost Everything. This to me, brings Great Concern of what will one day come ðŸ«´
