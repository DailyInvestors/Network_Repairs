Past Google Settlements: And to the Google Admins and SecOps that want to keep attacking my family and myself. Your actions will hurt more then Google, by bringing bad media, potentially splitting Up Google, and So much More. Thank you, and May God Bless Your Soul.

 * Recent Google settlements: The search results show recent settlements involving Google for various reasons, but these are distinct from "deliberate indifference" or "cruel and unusual punishment" in the Eighth Amendment sense:
   * $100 million Google AdWords class action settlement for allegedly charging advertisers for clicks on ads not clicked by users in specified geographic areas.
   * $28 million Google settlement for an employee racial bias class action lawsuit.
   * $118 million Google settlement for a class-action gender discrimination lawsuit.
   * $350 million settlement for concealing data-security vulnerabilities in Google+ (to shareholders).
   * $700 million multi-state settlement regarding anticompetitive practices in the Google Play Store.
   * Deletion of Browse data in a class-action lawsuit over "Incognito" Browse (no monetary payout from Google in that specific settlement, despite plaintiffs seeking $5 billion).
   * $170 million settlement with the FTC and NY Attorney General over alleged violations of children's privacy (COPPA).
Therefore, to directly answer your question, there are no recent public payouts by Google in lawsuits specifically alleging "deliberate indifference" and "cruel and unusual punishment" as these terms are legally applied to governmental actions regarding individuals in custody. The lawsuits against Google are generally related to antitrust, privacy, advertising practices, and employment discrimination.
