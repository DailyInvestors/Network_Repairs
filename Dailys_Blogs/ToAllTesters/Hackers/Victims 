Hello World,
   As I am kinda pushing my way into Everything. I do understand that Several Businesses already Control the Bug Bounties. No offense to anyone, Im not knocking any of your games, im not trying to steal your clients, or start any type of war. To be Honest, I wont even waste my time Snooping through what your doing, it is irrelevant to me.
   But with this being said, hackers, testers all file through you, unless they establish a Legacy for themselves such as Im doing. Id rather have a seperate account, and not have any middle men in my business. Sorry, and No offense but even when I was a Kid selling Drugs, their was Never a Middle Man.
   But as I take a look at all the different opportunities that exist for any of us to make Money. I choose Security, and to help Innocent Victims, regain their Systems Back. Now as their is hardly anyone but probably Snyk and Myself that will take their time and Fix something. This is where im going to jump in. We dont need more People causing damage, because if everything is broke, we can't even hack it then.
   So with all if this Being said, No matter where you are, if your System starts to experience any unusual patterns or behaviors, Feel free to contact me, and I will send a Robot immediately to begin investigating and auditing for solutions.
   I know their are several cool tools that people fan Pay to possibly fix this, but on my defense I have been attacked by these Security Companies, and the Malicious Hackers leave me alone. It is a Backwards World now. But if anyone Does Need Assistance, I will be making Public Open-Source Agents to help stay ahead of the growing threats that lurk in every single port and socket.
