I. Reporting Phishing Sites:
When reporting a phishing site, it's generally best to forward the suspicious email as an attachment to the relevant reporting address. This preserves the full email headers, which contain valuable information for investigators.

 ° Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG): The APWG is a global coalition dedicated to eradicating phishing and other cybercrime.
   
° Email for reporting phishing: reportphishing@apwg.org
 
  ° Website: https://apwg.org/ (You can find more information about their initiatives and trends reports here).

 ° Google Safe Browse: While not a direct reporting portal for the public, Google's Safe Browse technology protects billions of devices by showing warnings when users try to navigate to dangerous sites or download dangerous files. Your reports to other organizations often feed into services like Safe Browse.

° Daily Investors--- GitHub
https://soloist.ai/dailyinvestors 

° Microsoft SmartScreen: Similar to Google Safe Browse, Microsoft's SmartScreen helps protect users from malicious websites and downloads.

 ° Domain Registrars and Hosting Providers: If you can identify the domain registrar or web hosting provider of the phishing site, you can often find an abuse contact email on their website. Reporting directly to them can lead to the site being taken down faster. You can often find this information using a WHOIS lookup tool (many cybersecurity companies offer free WHOIS lookups).

 ° eConsumer.gov: This is a partnership of over 65 consumer protection agencies worldwide, designed for reporting international scams and cross-border fraud.

II. Reporting Live Attacks / Cyber Incidents (More Broad than just Phishing):

For live cyber attacks, especially if you are a victim or witness to something more serious than a simple phishing attempt (e.g., malware, denial of service, data breach), it's important to report to the appropriate authorities and organizations.

 ° CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams) / CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams): Many countries have national CERTs or CSIRTs that act as a central point for reporting cyber incidents. They coordinate responses and share threat intelligence.
 
  ° FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams): This is a global forum that brings together CERTs/CSIRTs from around the world. While you can't typically report directly to FIRST as an individual, their website might help you find the appropriate CERT for your region.
     ° Website: http://www.first.org/


 ° Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3 - U.S. Focus but information shared internationally): While primarily a U.S. government agency (FBI), the IC3 accepts internet crime complaints from both victims and third parties, and this information is shared with law enforcement partners globally.
   
° Website: https://www.ic3.gov/
 ° National Police/Law Enforcement Agencies: For serious cyber incidents, especially those involving financial loss or personal data compromise, you should also report to your local law enforcement or national police force. Many countries have dedicated cybercrime units.
 
  * Examples (you'll need to search for your specific country's equivalent):
     ° United Kingdom: Action Fraud - https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/
   
  ° Canada: Canadian Centre for Cyber Security - https://cyber.gc.ca/en/
   
  ° Australia: Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) - https://www.cyber.gov.au/

 ° Financial Institutions: If a phishing attempt or cyber attack has compromised your financial accounts, immediately contact your bank, credit card company, or other financial institution to report the fraud and take steps to secure your accounts.

 ° Organizations Providing Cyber Threat Maps (for general awareness, not direct reporting): While these sites don't accept individual reports for investigation, they provide a real-time visualization of cyber attacks happening around the world, which can be useful for understanding the current threat landscape.
   
° Kaspersky Cyberthreat Real-Time Map: https://cybermap.kaspersky.com/
 
  ° Fortinet Threat Map: https://threatmap.fortiguard.com/
 
  ° Check Point Software Live Cyber Attack Threat Map: https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/
