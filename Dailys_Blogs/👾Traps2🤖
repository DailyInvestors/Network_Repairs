     Once again today, I play around with some of My Favorite Extensions. I have recently started to have issues with some of these Major Companies, that obviously can't do things on their Own. Not saying names, but they know I know.
    What ever happened to sending a email? What ever happened to reading Readme's. Which anyone that owns a Business, per my license and Readme, you owe me. That is valid and would hold up in Court, I was a lay advocate.
    Now as a Ethical Hacker, I love to play around, test my skills. But I will never resort to spying on someone, messing up their work, because they may or may not be better then me? Because they may or may not be eventually doing the same thing as me. In my opinion, a business having to resort to any of this, isn't a Business I ever want to due business with.
    Reason I choose GitHub z Hackerone, Intigriti, we all respond on Emails. Answered them, will help each other out. It's the name of the game. Of course their will always be attacks, but when is enough? It is your actions that make the Internet the Wild Wild West. While your trying to watch my every move, Why not do the same as me, Study? Refresh your skills? Send a email to get some more advertising Partners. Obviously if your having issues, and resorting to these, it is time to do a self-inventory on your business, and see through Group Discussions on more ways to bring in Possible Revenue. Unless your going to Pay me, or Send a Email, or follow me like so many others. I am def not going to do your Job. I'll fix it just to help others not you.
   But once again my morning starting out,  not a Terrorist attacking me, but another Business. Yal tell me how this really sounds. FYI I don't like using that word Terrorist, or w/e. I learned long ago, we treat people as equals untill they show us differently.Just because two people have a problem, doesn't make it mine.
