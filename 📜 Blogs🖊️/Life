Hello World,
   Their is either a Big going on in this Repo or someone attempting to hack this Repo. Later today I'll run a series of Tests. I will be Testing my .gist strength, dependencies, and some more playing around with Curl. However, despite their already being a Phishing page imitating my Tasks Project, Their is No Need to Fear. This is not Facebook, and Since in America it is illegal to attack Back. I'm going to think long and hard,bon what I can make and bypass all that. Make something like a firework, when the attacker goes into the system, silent in the background it sends out a 1000 bots for passive recon on the attacker. üßê
