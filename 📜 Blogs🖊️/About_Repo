Good Afternoon,
   With all greatest comes Great Change. I previously purged  my old Directory for my Past Blogs. The new Style I am creating will be specifically for Repairs, and this Repo only. 
  So a quick introduction about me.
I have been studying Offensive Defense for four years Full Time. 8-12 Hour Shifts a Day. Open Source, Courses, Books, LinkedIn Learning, and my College Education. Which my entire College Education was basically Sabbatoged. ðŸ’¯. But on my defense, it was the Best Background I feel I could have. Why? Policies and Procedures.
   All these different organizations, basically everything is the same. Just a little different. I hold Hundreds of Certificates from The Best of Best. As I am currently that Typical Broke Developer that is just waiting for His Time. My philosophy, in order to get anywhere or what you want, Hard Work and Dedication is a MUST. 
   I have survived Cyber Wars with some of The Biggest Technology Companies ever. But because of my past criminal history, basically some of these Corporations are being Deliberately Different towards me. However, I use this as my Motivation to keep pushing forward, to never give up. Cyber Attacks are Up 150% this year,
   So now for my Future Blogs, this will be Ranging from AI Lessons, True AI Stories. I will Teach Defense, on how to Fix, Repair, Rebuild, Validate, and so on.
   While this is the Fresh Blog for this Future GitHub Site, let's talk about one of The Best Tools Around. Hayden BootCD. This Universal Live Boot USB, can help any Business out. It how should be a Must Have for any IT or Admin. This tool, can fix any crypto lock, rebuild your Partitions, Anti-Virus for Rootkits, and So Much More. 
  Even the Best Hacker on Here, still gets hacked. Nothing is Perfect, but in order to save Thousands, these Simple Tools and Strategies that I will be teaching Each and Everyone of you, are essentials that anyone on a Computer Should Know.
