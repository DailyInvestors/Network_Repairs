## How You Can Patch & Upgrade

1. **Dependency Review:** Double-check for any insecure or deprecated dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `setup.py`.
2. **Input Sanitization:** Improve how log data is sanitized/encoded before being output as JSON—look for places where user input may be logged without proper escaping.
3. **Add Security Tests:** Contribute tests that ensure malicious input can’t break or escape the logger format.
4. **Update Documentation:** Propose best security practices for users of the logger.

## Example Bug Report & Patch Suggestion

**Title:** Improve Input Sanitization in Log Formatter for Security

**Body:**
> While reviewing the code, I noticed that user-supplied log messages or metadata are not explicitly sanitized before being serialized to JSON. This could potentially allow for log injection or other attacks if downstream log consumers are not robust.  
> 
> **Suggested Patch:**  
> - Implement input sanitization or validation before writing logs.
> - Add tests for malicious payloads to ensure safe handling.
> 
> This will further harden ant current Library that uses these functions.
