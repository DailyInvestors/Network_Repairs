Transfers

Description: With Technology being the forefront for almost every single Business. With this being said, we have to know what To Secure against, and the Newer Technology that might aid in assistance when we need to transfer files, upload, or receive. During a live attack, you kay be in a urgency or a deadline, and knowing one port is being listened in to, a different Transfer Protocol could be the difference between a successful transfer, or pre-secured against. ðŸ¤”
