âœ¨ Wall of SHAME âœ¨ 

Description: As i get attacked so much, and purposely not using any if my window systems due to this playing around. Every Malicious website that attcks my system, IP that attacks, or one of my robots catches trying to do incoming acans and connections this will be the page, I post the data.

1. rxfn.com 
{ Picked up by Two IDS, and a Robot for attacking my network.

2.100.115.92.200 

3.100.115.92.193 
Caught this and the one above bouncing from port to port stealing bytes of data every 5 minutes or so. If it was a GoogleBot it would be every few seconds. Any unknown IP in any system, you have to treat as malicious.

This IP attacked me 40 times in a row. Came back for Two weeks, only consistency is their IP.

5. cdn.tapioni.com
Attacked my Apple Device. Never on their Site.

23.1 1/2 hours ago started attacking us.
sync.pmbmonetize.live
{ Did a Passive Recon on them, truth be told there attacking People with Their Ports Open lol}
(80/tcp    open     http
135/tcp   filtered msrpc
139/tcp   filtered netbios-ssn
443/tcp   open     https
445/tcp   filtered microsoft-ds
593/tcp   filtered http-rpc-epmap
30000/tcp open     ndmps)
ðŸ’ŽJust to show my Recon Skills, and no it doesn't violate any laws. But my opinion could be a Tester, could be malicious, could be the cops. So instead of filing a Report, got my wall of Shame. Now if mitre does something with this list, that's a different story lol
Note: My recon, I can def give the credit there to Cert Mike lol.


Note: I only post malicious sites, that my Tools and Robots caoture attacking, scanning, transferring inside my system. Before I pkace the data on this Repo. I verify with all Public Records to ensure this is not apart of a site that I am currently on. This is not slandering any Business Name, but facts. Even if im on your site, and get attacked by someone else, through your site. Still going on my Wall of Shame. Why a Wall of Shame? Cus I caught you. lol 

With All of These said Above. No one around me on this Network, in this Device or my Devices have Gone to any of These.
