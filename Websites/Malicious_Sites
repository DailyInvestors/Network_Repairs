Description: As i get attacked so much, and purposely not using any if my window systems due to this playing around. Every Malicious website that attcks my system, IP that attacks, or one of my robots catches trying to do incoming acans and connections this will be the page, I post the data.

1. rxfn.com 
{ Picked up by Two IDS, and a Robot for attacking my network.

2.100.115.92.200 

3.100.115.92.193 
Caught this and the one above bouncing from port to port stealing bytes of data every 5 minutes or so. If it was a GoogleBot it would be every few seconds. Any unknown IP in any system, you have to treat as malicious.

4. 23.92.127.34 
This IP attacked me 40 times in a row. Came back for Two weeks, only consistency is their IP.

5. cdn.tapioni.com
Attacked my Apple Device. Never on their Site.

6. hentaiworld.tv
Attacked my Apple Device. Never have been on this site 

7. 224.0.0.251
Just got caught on my IDS for taking partial raw data from my SMTP Port and sent it to their Port 1900. Which is unlocked. Ran whois, and thats what im saying who are you.

8. My Gemini is acting up. Going through Dev Tools, this company in London I captured one of my requests going to. Never heard of them.
138.199.22.103
It variation ID, keeps altering between 10 different randomized IPs. Request states Playlog server? Private Cache 



Note: I only post malicious sites, that my Tools and Robots caoture attacking, scanning, transferring inside my system. Before I pkace the data on this Repo. I verify with all Public Records to ensure this is not apart of a site that I am currently on. This is not slandering any Business Name, but facts. Even if im on your site, and get attacked by someone else, through your site. Still going on my Wall of Shame. Why a Wall of Shame? Cus I caught you. lol
