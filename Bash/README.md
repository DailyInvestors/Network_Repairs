   

How to Use and Customize:
 * Save: Save the code as a .sh file (e.g., linux_maintenance.sh).
 * Make Executable: chmod +x linux_maintenance.sh
 * Review and Customize:
   * Network Repair Stage (network_repair_stage):
     * CRITICAL: The commands here (netplan apply, systemctl restart NetworkManager, ip link set, dhclient) are highly dependent on your Linux distribution and how its network is configured.
     * netplan: Common on modern Ubuntu.
     * NetworkManager: Common on desktop distributions and some servers.
     * networking.service: Older Debian/Ubuntu style.
     * ip / ifconfig: Universal for interface manipulation, but ip is preferred.
     * dhclient: For DHCP-managed interfaces.
     * Ping Tests: You can add more ping tests to specific internal/external hosts.
     * Be cautious with ip link set down/up on remote systems if you don't have alternative access.
   * Autoremove Stage (autoremove_stage):
     * This uses apt, dnf, or yum based on what's found. It should be generally safe.
   * Clean DNS Cache Stage (clean_dns_stage):
     * This covers systemd-resolved, dnsmasq, and nscd â€“ the most common local DNS caching services.
     * If you use a different local DNS cache (e.g., Unbound running as a local resolver), you'll need to add commands to restart or flush its cache.
 * Error Handling: The || exit 1 pattern will stop the script immediately if a command fails within a function. You might want more sophisticated error handling (e.g., set -e at the top, or more specific error messages).
 * Logging: All output is directed to the console and LOG_FILE. Errors also go to the log.
 * Running:
   * sudo ./linux_maintenance.sh


This is a basic skeleton designed toward Network Repairs. This is for educational purposes only, if needed for usage, you kust modify these settings for your environment and preferences of tools.
